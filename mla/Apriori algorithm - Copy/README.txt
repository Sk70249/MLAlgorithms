					Implementing Apriori algorithm in Python
Prerequisites: Apriori Algorithm
Apriori Algorithm is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used to gain insight into the structured relationships between different items involved. The most prominent practical application of the algorithm is to recommend products based on the products already present in the userâ€™s cart. Walmart especially has made great use of the algorithm in suggesting products to its users.
Dataset: Groceries data

Implementation of algorithm in Python:

Step 1: Importing the required libraries
Step 2: Loading and exploring the data
Step 3: Cleaning the Data
Step 4: Splitting the data according to the region of transaction
Step 5: Hot encoding the Data
Step 6: Building the models and analyzing the results
